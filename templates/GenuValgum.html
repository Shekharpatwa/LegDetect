        <p>
          <h4>
            Genu valgum, known as knock-knees, is a knee misalignment that turns your knees inward.
            When people with knock-knees stand up with their knees together, there’s a gap of 3 inches or more between their ankles. 
            This is because their knees are bent so far inward. <br>

            <div class="c1">
               <p> Genu valgum can also develop later in life from:</p>
                    <ol style="list-style-type:circle"> 
                        <li> an injury or infection in your knee or leg </li> 
                        <li> severe lack of vitamin D and calcium </li>
                        <li> obesity </li>
                        <li> arthritis in the knee </li>
                    </ol>
            </div>
            
            <p> This condition can’t be prevented, but its effects can be minimized.
            Physical therapy and exercise are often a successful alternative to surgery. Keep reading to learn more.</p>

        <h1 id="symptoms"> What are the symptoms of genu valgum ?</h1>
        <p><h4>
            Genu valgum that persists beyond childhood may have other symptoms besides misaligned knees. <br>
            They include:
            <ol style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li> stiff joints </li>
                <li> knee pain </li>
                <li> walking with a limp </li>
            </ol>

            Stressed ligaments and muscles can also cause pain in your hips, ankles, or feet.If only one knee is out of line, your stance may be unbalanced. </h4>
